\section{Applications and evaluation}

We now describe some of the possible applications of sidechains.

\noindent
\textbf{Remote ICO. } In this application, a group wants to fundraise by
performing an ICO~\cite{ico}.

% remote ICO
% atomic swaps
% cardano mainchain/sidechain
% scalability (trivial sharding)
% interoperability with private blockchains (regulator compliance)
% upgradability
