\section{Applications}

We give two futher applications of sidechains beyond the two-way peg.

\noindent
\textbf{Remote ICOs. } A group wants to fund raise by performing an
ICO \cite{ico} on a certain feature-rich target blockchain such as
Ethereum. Investors who wish to purchase tokens are holding their cryptocurrency
they wish to pay with on a different source blockchain with lower
volatility such as Bitcoin. In this context, instead of trading Bitcoin for
Ethereum, the investors can directly pay in Bitcoin and receive their ICO tokens
on the Ethereum blockchain. Furthermore, the value of tokens can be denominated
in Bitcoin.

The course of action is as follows: Initially, the fundraising entity creates a
\emph{fund raiser} address on the source blockchain, in our example the
Bitcoin blockchain. The fundraising entity also creates a
\emph{token generator}~\cite{openzeppelin-crowdsale} smart contract on the
target blockchain, in our example the Ethereum blockchain. The
token generator contract is initialized with the source blockchain
genesis hash and the fund raiser address. The token generator contract contains
a \textsf{withdraw} method which allows receiving the ICO tokens. The fundraising
entity then advertises both the address and the smart contracts and allows
investors to inspect them. An investor subsequently deposits bitcoin into the
fund raiser address. The investor subsequently generates a NIPoPoW $\pi$
for the deposit and submits it to the \textsf{withdraw} method of the token
generator function. Upon verification of $\pi$, the investor receives their ICO
tokens. This application is a special case of a \emph{one-way peg} with
extra rules such as a limited timeframe or dynamic pricing.

\noindent
\textbf{Atomic swaps. } Two mutually distrusting parties wish to exchange coins
between two different chains, for example ETH for ETC, without using a
centralized exchange. Alice wants to pay Bob in ETH and Bob wants to pay Alice
in ETC. While atomic swaps are already possible using hash
locks~\cite{atomicswaps,herlihy2018atomic}, our construction provides an
alternative possibility: One contract is created on the target blockchain, in
our example Ethereum, and is made aware of the remote genesis block as well as
an address on the source blockchain, in our case Alice's Ethereum Classic
address. Then, Alice deposits ether into the \textsf{deposit} function of the
contract that sits on the target blockchain. The ether remains locked for a
designated period of time. In the meantime, Bob pays Alice in Ethereum Classic
by creating a regular transaction on the Ethereum Classic blockchain. He then
generates a proof $\pi$ that this transaction took place and is paying into
Alice's account. By submitting $\pi$ into the \textsf{withdraw} function of the
contract that sits on the target blockchain, Bob receive his ether payment,
contingent on the fact that he has paid Alice. In case Bob aborts the protocol,
Alice is able to withdraw her money from the source blockchain contract by
calling an \textsf{abort} function, which is only callable as soon as a
sufficient number of blocks have passed. As long as Bob cooperates in a timely
manner, Alice is unable to call \textsf{abort} due to the timelock, and hence
the protocol is atomic.

% \textbf{Firewalling complex blockchains. } The two most popular cryptocurrencies
% are currently Bitcoin and Ethereum. The popularity of Bitcoin stems from the
% fact that it has maintained stable behavior and can be relied on for security.
% Their features are limited and their codebase is updated in a careful manner. On
% the other hand, Ethereum innovates quickly and is Turing-complete. Hence,
% Bitcoin is often used as a \emph{savings accounts} platform because it is safe,
% while Ethereum is used as a \emph{checking accounts} platform because it is
% feature rich. The problem stems from the fact that exchanges between these two
% chains are constantly needed and are prone to volatility and market fees.
% However, with sidechains, it is possible to get the best of both worlds. To
% solve this problem in a new coin, a blockchain system consisting of \emph{two
% blockchains} is created. The Bitcoin-like blockchain, or \emph{settlement
% layer}, contains limited features and a codebase which is easily auditable. The
% Ethereum-like blockchain, or \emph{computation layer}, is feature-rich and its
% codebase is larger but harder to audit. The \emph{settlement layer} then issues
% currency which can be transferred to the \emph{computation layer} (which does
% not have its own currency) and back using two-way pegged sidechains, without
% paying market fees or being subject to exchange volatility. In case a
% catastrophic security issue occurs in the \emph{computation layer}, the
% \emph{settlement layer} remains macroeconomically protected.
%
% \noindent
% \textbf{Scaling with sidechains. } Scalability is one of the most prominent
% problems in blockchain space~\cite{bitcoinng,sompolinsky2013accelerating}.
% Sidechains are a trivial way to \emph{shard} a blockchain system into multiple
% blockchains, achieving higher transaction throughput. This method can be
% combined with existing sharding techniques such as Bitcoin-NG~\cite{bitcoinng}
% applied independently on each blockchain. Similar to the example above, a system
% which wishes to achieve these scalability gains would have one baseline
% blockchain designated as their \emph{settlement layer}. In this construction,
% the settlement layer is the only blockchain which issues currency. In addition,
% a separate blockchain is created on an as-needed basis, which does not have its
% own currency, but can exchange coins with the parent \emph{settlement layer}
% using two-way pegged sidechains. The creation of children blockchains can even
% be user-initiated. If transactions occur intra-chain, they do not need to touch
% the settlement layer. Inter-chain transactions between two different children
% chains can occur by first moving coins from the source blockchain to the
% settlement layer with one transaction and subsequently from the settlement layer
% to the target blockchain with another. In order for this system to successfully
% scale, most transactions need to be confined within a single blockchain. This
% can be achieved if, for instance, each blockchain created is specific to a
% particular industry. The suppliers and consumers of an industry can then
% interact with each other within their designated blockchain and only need to
% move their capital to the settlement layer in order to interact with suppliers
% or consumers across industries.
%
% \noindent
% \textbf{Legacy interoperability. } A fundamental problem of blockchain systems
% is that they are difficult to operate within the regulatory framework of
% governments. This makes it difficult to move capital between legacy banking and
% blockchains, as they stand at two extremes: Legacy banking is heavily regulated
% to control every transaction, while blockchains, at least at the transaction
% level, can be used despite regulation that may exist, which can remain
% unenforceable, especially for anonymous users. Hence, banks are reluctant to
% interoperate with blockchains. An intermediate solution can be reached with
% sidechains. A parent blockchain can be created which is completely
% decentralized. Subsequently, each bank, regulator, or government can operate a
% private or semi-private blockchain~\cite{danezis2015centrally} as a sidechain
% which can interact via two-way pegs with the parent decentralized chain. The
% regulators can then apply the laws they desire on both intra-chain transactions
% within the private blockchain as well as the cross-chain transfers between their
% private blockchain and the decentralized parent blockchain. Such regulation
% could, for instance, allow only white-listed entities to interact with the
% system, or require a bank or government to sign off every transaction using
% centrally held private keys. However, regulation concerning the decentralized
% parent blockchain would remain unenforceable at the transaction level. As such,
% moving assets from the decentralized blockchain into the regulated blockchain
% would happen on a voluntary basis if a party deemed that it wishes to encumber
% itself with a particular legal and regulatory framework.
%
% \noindent
% \textbf{Upgradability. } Sidechains also allow for upgradability, taking the
% place of difficult to manage hard forks. After all, this was their original
% purpose when they were envisioned~\cite{sidechains}. In the upgradability
% application, a child blockchain is created to provide supplemental features to
% an existing parent blockchain. Using two-way pegs, the two blockchains can
% transfer assets between them on a voluntary basis, without requiring users to
% follow a hard fork or soft fork contrary to their will. If eventually the child
% chain becomes more popular than the parent blockchain, the parent blockchain can
% eventually be sunset, completing the upgrade process. This technique can also be
% used to \emph{abandon ship} in case a parent blockchain is found to have a
% long-term security issue which cannot be immediately exploited, such as a
% suspicion for a cryptographically secure hash weakness. If enough time is
% available to create a sidechain and have users move all their assets to it, this
% method allows securely moving away from a suspected insecure system. In this
% case, the two-way peg could be carefully constructed to have a time limited
% after which no more funds can further be transferred from the parent blockchain
% into the child blockchain, effectively severing the link between the two and
% making the child blockchain independent.
