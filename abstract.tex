    Sidechains are a mechanism for securely transferring value from one
    blockchain to another. While the idea of sidechains has been defined
    previously, none of the constructions have been made concrete. In this work,
    we describe how to concretely build sidechains for proof-of-work
    blockchains. We describe two general types of sidechains: Parent-child
    sidechains, in which the sidechain is created as an upgrade of its parent
    blockchain, and stand-alone sidechains, in which two stand-alone blockchains
    are able to communicate even though they started independently. We describe
    the conditions which allow the creation of sidechains and prove that our
    construction is secure. We base our sidechain construction on a new
    cryptographic primitive recently introduced, Non-Interactive Proofs of
    Proof-of-Work. Finally, we briefly discuss the economics and applications of
    this implementation and conclude with experimental data showing the
    feasibility of our scheme.
