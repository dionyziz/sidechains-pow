\section{Construction}
\subsection*{Cross-chain certificates}
For our construction, we use a primitive called Non-Interactive Proofs of
Proof-of-Work recently introduced in~\cite{nipopows}.
Non-Interactive Proofs of Proofs-of-Work are cryptographic protocols which
implement a \emph{prover} and a \emph{verifier}. The prover is a \emph{full
node} on the \emph{source blockchain}. The verifier does not have access to
that blockchain, but knows its genesis block $\mathcal{G}$. The prover wants to
convince the verifier that an \emph{event} took place in the source blockchain;
for instance, a smart contract method was called with certain parameters or that
a payment was made into a particular address. Whether such an event took place
can easily be determined if one inspects the whole blockchain. However, the
prover wishes to convince the verifier by only sending a \emph{succinct proof},
a short string which does not grow linearly  with the size of the blockchain,
but, rather, \emph{polylogarithmically}. The verifier must not be fooled by
\emph{adversarial provers} who provide incorrect proofs claiming that an event
happened while in fact it didn't, or that it didn't while in fact it did. To
withstand such attacks, the verifier accepts multiple proofs, at least one of
which is assumed to have been honestly generated. Comparing these proofs against
each other, the verifier extracts a reliable truth value corresponding to the
same value it would deduce if it were to be running a full node on the
blockchain itself. This property is the \emph{security} of NIPoPoWs proven
in~\cite{nipopows}.

The NIPoPoWs construction talks about \emph{predicates} evaluated on
blockchains, but we are interested in \emph{events}. We can translate from
events to predicates provable with NIPoPoWs. Specifically, given a genesis block
$\mathcal{G}$, a smart contract address \textsf{addr}, an event name
\textsf{Event}, and a series of event parameter values $(\textsf{param}_1,
\textsf{param}_2, \cdots, \textsf{param}_n)$, the predicate $e$ we wish to check
for truth is the following: \emph{Has the event named \textsf{Event} been fired
with parameters $(\textsf{param}_1, \textsf{param}_2, \cdots, \textsf{param}_n)$
by the smart contract residing in address \textsf{addr} on the blockchain with
genesis block $\mathcal{G}$ at least $k$ blocks ago?} This predicate
is (1) \emph{monotonic}, meaning that it starts with the value \textsf{false}
and, if it ever becomes \textsf{true}, it cannot ever change its value back as
the blockchain grows; (2) \emph{infix-sensitive}, meaning that its truth value
can be deduced by inspecting a constant number of blocks on the blockchain (one
block, within which the event firing was confirmed); and (3) \emph{stable},
meaning that, if one party deduces that its value is \textsf{true}, then soon
enough \emph{all} parties will deduce that its value is \textsf{true}. This last
property stems from the requirement that the event be buried under $k$ blocks
ensuring a blockchain reorganization up to $k$ blocks ago cannot affect the
predicate's value.

In order to determine whether an event took place, the NIPoPoW verifier function
\textsf{verify}$^{\mathcal{G},e}_{k,m}(\mathcal{P})$ accepts the event
description in the form of a blockchain predicate $e$, which we gave above, the
genesis block of the remote chain $\mathcal{G}$, as well as two security
parameters $k$ and $m$. These security parameters can be constants specified
when the sidechain system is created (concrete values for these are given
in~\cite{nipopows}). Subsequently, the NIPoPoW verifier accepts a set of
\emph{proofs} $\mathcal{P} = \{\pi_1, \pi_2, \cdots, \pi_n\}$ which it compares
and extracts a truth value for the predicate: Whether the event has taken place
in the remote blockchain or not. As long as at least one \emph{honestly
generated} proof $\pi_i$ is provided, the verifier's security ensures that the
output will correspond to whether the event actually occurred.

Our protocol works as follows. Whenever an event of interest occurs on the
source blockchain, the occurence of this event is observed by a source
blockchain honest node, who generates a NIPoPoW about it. The target blockchain
contains a smart contract with a method to accept and verify the veracity of
this proof. The node can then submit the proof to the smart contract by
broadcasting a transaction on the target blockchain. As soon as the proof is
validated by the smart contract, the target blockchain can elect to react to the
event as desired.

\noindent
\textbf{Adoption considerations. } Our construction has certain prerequisites
for both the source and the target blockchain before it can be adopted. In the
case of bidirectionally connected blockchains, both of them must satisfy the
source and the target blockchain prerequisites.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{The source blockchain} needs to support \emph{proofs} about it,
        which requires augmenting it with an \emph{interlink} vector, the
        details of which can be found in~\cite{popow}. This interlink vector
        can be added to a blockchain using a \emph{user-activated velvet
        fork}~\cite{nipopows,velvet}, which is performed without miner awareness
        and does not require a hard or soft fork. However, only events occuring
        \emph{after} the velvet fork can be proven. New blockchains can adopt
        this from genesis.
  \item \textbf{The target blockchain} needs to be able to run the above
        \textsf{verify} function. This function can be programmed in a
        Turing-complete language such as Solidity. If the source blockchain
        proof-of-work hash function is available as an opcode or pre-compiled
        smart contract within the target blockchain's VM the way, e.g.,
        Bitcoin's SHA256 hash function is available in Solidity, the
        implementation can be more gas-efficient.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{Blockchain agnosticism. }
We underline the remarkable property that miners and full nodes of the target
blockchain do not need to be aware of the source blockchain at all. To them,
all information about the source blockchain is simply a string which is passed
as a parameter to a smart contract and can remain \emph{agnostic} to its
semantics as a proof. Additionally, miners and full nodes of the source
blockchain do not need to be aware of the target blockchain. Only the parties
interested in facilitating cross-chain events must be aware of both. Those
untrusted facilitators need to maintain an SPV node on the source blockchain
with which they generate their NIPoPoW. To broadcast their proof on the target
blockchain, they connect to target blockchain nodes and send the transaction
containing the NIPoPoW. Blockchain agnosticism allows users to initiate
cross-chain relationships between different blockchains \emph{dynamically}, as
long as the blockchains in question satisfy the above prerequisites.

\subsection*{Cross-chain events}

We give our \textsf{crosschain} construction in Algorithm~\ref{alg.crosschain}.
Initially, our communication will be unidirectional. In the next section, we
will use two unidirectional channels to establish bidirectional communication.
This smart contract runs on the target blockchain and informs it about events
that took place in the source blockchain. It is parameterized by three
parameters: $k$ and $m$ are the underlying security parameters of the NIPoPoW
protocol. The value $z$ is a \emph{collateral} parameter, denominated in ether
(or the native currency of the blockchain in which the execution takes place)
and is used to incentivize honest participants to intervene in cases of false
claims. The contract utilizes the NIPoPoW \textsf{verify} function parameterized
by the event $e$, the remote genesis block $\mathcal{G}$ and the security
parameters $k$ and $m$. We do not give an explicit implementation of
\textsf{verify}, as it can be implemented in a straightforward manner by
translating the pseudocode listing of~\cite{nipopows}. For our purposes, it
suffices to treat it as a black box which, given a set of proofs, at least one
of which is honestly generated, returns the truth value of the respective
predicate.

\import{./}{algorithms/crosschain.tex}

The contract allows detecting remote blockchain events can be \emph{inherited}
by other contracts that wish to adopt its functionality. It works as follows.
First, the \textsf{initialize} method is called exactly once to configure the
contract, passing the \emph{hash} of the genesis block of the remote chain which
this contract will handle. This method is \textsf{internal} and can only be
called by the contract inheriting from it. Users of the contract can check  it
has been configured with the correct genesis block prior to using it. We note
that, while our algorithm does not reflect this to keep complexity low, it is
possible to have a contract interact with \emph{multiple} remote chains by
extending it to include multiple geneses.

\begin{figure}[H]

             when communicating with both blockchain networks and the lifecycle
             of an event submission}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9 \columnwidth,keepaspectratio]{figures/sequence-diagram.pdf}
    \label{fig.sequence}
\end{figure}

The lifecycle of an event submission is illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig.sequence}. When an event has taken place in the source
blockchain, any source blockchain SPV node, the \emph{author}, can inform the
\textsf{crosschain} contract about this fact by generating a NIPoPoW $\pi$
claiming that the event took place based on their current view of the source
blockchain. This proof can then be submitted to the target blockchain by calling
the \textsf{submit-event-proof} function and passing it the proof $\pi$ and the
event predicate $e$. The submission is accompanied by a collateral payment $z$.
If the author is honest, this collateral will be returned to her later. The
\textsf{submit-event-proof} function runs the NIPoPoW \textsf{verify} algorithm
to check that the proof $\pi$ is well-formed and that it claims that the
predicate is \textsf{true}. It then stores the proof for later use. It also
stores the address of the \emph{author} and an \emph{expiration block number}.

Upon submission of a proof to the \textsf{submit-event-proof} function, the
event is \emph{tentatively accepted} for a \emph{contestation period} of $k$
blocks, during which any other party, the \emph{contester}, can provide a
counter-proof showing that the original proof was fraudulent. The contester can
call the \textsf{submit-contesting-proof} function passing it the contesting
proof $\pi^*$ and the event predicate $e$. The function runs the NIPoPoW
\textsf{verify} algorithm to compare the original proof
$\textsf{events}[e].\textsf{proof}$ against the contesting proof $\pi^*$. If the
verification algorithm concludes that the original proof was fraudulent, the
tentatively accepted event is abandoned and the collateral is paid to the
contester.

Otherwise, when the contestation period has expired without any valid
contestations, the author can call the \textsf{finalize-event} function. This
function changes the acceptance of the event from tentative to \emph{permanent}
by including it in the \textsf{finalized-events} set and returns the collateral
to the author. Finally, the \textsf{event-exists} function can be used by the
inheriting contract to check if an event has been permanently accepted. The
target blockchain state during this execution is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig.contestation}. The source blockchain's event included in the
black box, upon sufficient confirmation by $k_1$ blocks (not shown), is
transmitted to the target blockchain at the bottom. The target blockchain
includes the event \emph{tentatively} in block $1$ until a contestation period
of $k_2$ has passed; the event is included \emph{permanently} in block $2$;
subsequently, permanent inclusion needs to be confirmed with $k_2$ further
blocks.

\subsection*{Two-way pegged sidechains}
Having created the generic crosschain contract, we now build two-way pegged
sidechains on top. For concreteness, we will use the example of
transferring ether (ETH), the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, to the
Ethereum Classic blockchain, and back. We note that this example is arbitrary
and for illustration. Our construction can be used between any work-based
blockchains satisfying the prerequisites detailed above.

When ether is moved to the Ethereum Classic blockchain, it will be represented
as an ERC20\footnote{The ERC20 standard~\cite{erc20} defines an interface
implementable by smart contracts that enables holding and transferring custom
fungible tokens such as ICO tokens.} token within Ethereum Classic. Let this
custom token be called ETH20. The asset retains its nature as it moves from one
blockchain to another if it is always possible to move ETH into ETH20 and back
at a one-to-one rate. The economic reason is that the price of ETH and ETH20 on
the market will necessarily be the same (with a possible small difference due to
the fees needed for a cross-chain transfer). For, if the price of ETH were to
ever be significantly above the price of ETH20 in the market, then a rational
participant would exchange their ETH20 for ETH using sidechains and sell their
ETH on the market instead, and vice versa. Hence, the two tokens are equivalent.

The sidechain smart contracts are presented in Algorithm~\ref{alg.sidechain}.
These smart contracts both extend the \textsf{crosschain} smart contract of
Algorithm~\ref{alg.crosschain}. Furthermore, \textsf{sidechain}$_2$ also
inherits basic \textsf{ERC20} functionality which allows token owners to
transfer the token~\cite{openzeppelin-erc20}. The \textsf{sidechain}$_1$
contract will be instantiated on Ethereum, while the \textsf{sidechain}$_2$
contract and will be instantiated on Ethereum Classic. Suppose the genesis block
hash of Ethereum is $\mathcal{G}_1$ and of Ethereum Classic is $\mathcal{G}_2$.
We will use the genesis block hash of each blockchain as its unique identifier.

The two smart contracts each contain an \textsf{initialize} method which accepts
the hash of the remote blockchain as well as the address of the remote smart
contract it will interface with. Note that, while the two genesis hashes can be
hard-coded into the respective smart contract code itself, the remote contract
address cannot be built-in as a constant into the smart contract, but must be
later specified by calling the \textsf{initialize} function. The reason is that,
if \textsf{sidechain}$_1$ were to be created on $\mathcal{G}_1$, it would
require the address of \textsf{sidechain}$_2$ to exist prior to its creation,
and vice versa in a circular dependency. Therefore, the two contracts must first
be created on their respective blockchain to obtain addresses, and then their
\textsf{initialize} methods can be called to inform each contract about the
address of the remote contract. Specifically, first the contract
\textsf{sidechain}$_1$ is created on $\mathcal{G}_1$ to obtain its instance
address which we will also denote \textsf{sidechain}$_1$. Then the second
contract, \textsf{sidechain}$_2$ is created on $\mathcal{G}_2$ to obtain its
address \textsf{sidechain}$_2$. Then, the \textsf{initialize} function of
\textsf{sidechain}$_1$ is called, passing it $\mathcal{G}_2$ and the address
\textsf{sidechain}$_2$. Finally, \textsf{initialize} is called on
\textsf{sidechain}$_2$, passing it $\mathcal{G}_1$ and the address
\textsf{sidechain}$_1$. These initialization parameters are stored by the
respective smart contracts for future use. As the \textsf{crosschain} contract
requires, the \textsf{initialize} method can only be called once. Any user
wishing to utilize this sidechain is expected to validate that the contracts
have been set up correctly and that \textsf{initialize} has been called with the
appropriate parameters.

\import{./}{algorithms/sidechain.tex}

Following our example with Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, \textsf{sidechain}$_1$
runs on the Ethereum blockchain and \textsf{sidechain}$_2$ runs on the Ethereum
Classic blockchain. \textsf{sidechain}$_1$ contains a \textsf{deposit} function
which is \emph{payable} in the native asset of Ethereum, ETH. When a user pays
ETH into the \textsf{deposit} function, the funds are kept by the smart contract
and can later be used to pay parties who wish to \emph{withdraw}, an operation
which can be performed by calling the \textsf{withdraw} function.
\textsf{sidechain}$_2$ contains similar \textsf{deposit} and \textsf{withdraw}
functions which, however, do not pay in the native currency of Ethereum Classic,
but instead maintain a \textsf{balance} mapping akin to a typical ERC20
implementation. The balance is updated when a user deposits or withdraws.

Moving funds from the Ethereum blockchain into the Ethereum Classic blockchain
works as follows. First, the user pays with ETH to call the \textsf{deposit}
function of \textsf{sidechain}$_1$ which resides on $\mathcal{G}_1$, passing the
\textsf{target} parameter which indicates their address in the Ethereum Classic
blockchain that they wish to receive the money into. This call emits an event,
\textsf{Deposited}$_1$ which contains the necessary data: the \textsf{target},
the \textsf{amount} paid, as well as a unique counter \textsf{ctr} to allow for
future payments of the same amount to the same target. When the event has been
emitted and buried under $k_1$ blocks within the Ethereum blockchain, the user
produces an Ethereum NIPoPoW $\pi_1$ about the predicate $e_1$ which claims that
the event \textsf{Deposited}$_1$ has been emitted in blockchain $\mathcal{G}_1$
with the particular parameters by the contract at address
\textsf{sidechain}$_1$. We will slightly abuse notation for event predicates and
let $e_1$ be specified by the tuple containing the contract address, event name
and parameters $(\textsf{sidechain}_1, \textsf{Deposited}_1, (\textsf{amount},
\textsf{target}, \textsf{ctr}))$, noting that there is an obvious correspondence
between the two.

Subsequently, the user calls the \textsf{submit-event-proof} function of
\textsf{sidechain}$_2$ (which is inherited from the \textsf{crosschain}
contract), passing the NIPoPoW $\pi_1$ and the event predicate $e_1$, paying
collateral $z$, which registers $e_1$ on \textsf{sidechain}$_2$ as tentative.
Because the user is honest, intuitively no adversary can produce a $\pi'_1$
which disproves their claim during the dispute period (we make this statement
more concrete later), and therefore the user waits for $k_2$ blocks for the
contestation period to expire. She then calls the \textsf{finalize-event}
function for $e_1$ and receives back the collateral $z$, marking the event
permanent. Finally, she calls the dual function \textsf{withdraw} of
\textsf{sidechain}$_2$, passing it the same parameters that $e_1$ was issued
with. The \textsf{withdraw} function checks that $e_1$ exists using the
\textsf{event-exists} method, which will return \textsf{true}. The user is then
credited with \textsf{amount} in their ETH20 balance stored in
$\textsf{balances}[\textsf{target}]$. Note that this increment in balance
creates brand new ETH20 tokens.

The user can then move around their ETH20 tokens by utilizing the functionality
inherited by \textsf{sidechain}$_2$ from the \textsf{ERC20} contract. They can
give parts of their tokens to others, receive tokens from others, and so on.
When some (not necessarily the same) user is ready to move some (not necessarily
the same) amount of ETH20 from the Ethereum Classic blockchain back into ETH
on the Ethereum blockchain, they follow the reverse procedure. Specifically,
they call the \textsf{withdraw} function of \textsf{sidechain}$_2$ which ensures
their ERC20 balance is sufficient, deduces the requested amount, and fires an
event $e_2$ as before. At this point, these particular ETH20 tokens are
destroyed by the balance deduction. Once $e_2$ is confirmed in $\mathcal{G}_2$,
the user produces the NIPoPoW $\pi_2$ about the predicate $e_2$ which claims
that a payment was made within $\mathcal{G}_2$. That proof is then submitted to
\textsf{sidechain}$_1$ by calling the \textsf{submit-event-proof} and
\textsf{finalize-event} functions as before. Last, the user calls the
\textsf{withdraw} function of \textsf{sidechain}$_1$, which uses the
\textsf{event-exists} function which will return \textsf{true}, finally paying
back the user the respective amount of ETH. Because the only way to create ETH20
tokens in \textsf{sidechain}$_2$ is by depositing ETH into
\textsf{sidechain}$_1$, there will always exist a sufficient balance of ETH
owned by the \textsf{sidechains}$_1$ smart contract to pay any requested
withdrawals.

% Prove correctness! (through succinctness of NIPoPoWs)
