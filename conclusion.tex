\textbf{Conclusion.}
We gave the first trustless Proof-of-Work sidechain construction based on
the NIPoPoWs primitive. We detailed the implementation of the verifier in the
form of a Solidity smart contract. We described how cross-chain events can
be used to give rise to two-way pegging, the original sidechains vision, and
argued for the need of cryptoeconomic collateral to disincentivise dishonest
behavior. Finally, we argued about the feasibility of our proposal and gave the
prerequisites for its adoption.
