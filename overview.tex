\section{Overview}
We wish to transfer assets from one blockchain to another and then back. When
assets can be transferred from one blockchain to another but not back, we call
it a \emph{one-way peg}. If assets can also be moved back, we call it a
\emph{two-way peg}. In each individual transfer of an asset, we have a
particular \emph{source blockchain}, from which the asset is moved, and a
particular \emph{target blockchain}, to which the asset is moved. In a sidechain
setting of two blockchains that are two-way pegged, both blockchains can
function as a source and a target blockchain for different transfers.

While the motivation for the construction is to be able to move assets from one
blockchain to another, we generalize the notion of sidechains from this strict
setting. In general, we would like the target blockchain to be able to react to
any \emph{event} that occurs on the source blockchain. Events within a
blockchain are any conditions to which local (to the particular blockchain)
smart contracts can react. For example, such events can be the fact that a
transaction with a particular \textsc{txid} took place, that a certain account
was paid a certain amount of money, or that a particular smart contract was
instantiated. Our sidechain construction allows the target blockchain to react
to events that took place on the source blockchain. This reaction can be
implemented in its target blockchain smart contracts. We describe our
construction in pseudocode similar to Ethereum' \emph{Solidity} and can be
readily implemented based on our high-level description. In Solidity, events can
be fired arbitrarily from within a smart contract and do not have a semantic
interpretation. In this setting, events are defined by Solidity using the
\textsf{event} type and have an \emph{event name}, a \emph{contract address}
which fired them, as well as certain parameter values. A contract can elect to
fire an event with any name and any parameters of its choice.

             included in the black block. The event is confirmed by being buried
             under $k_1$ blocks in the source blockchain. The target blockchain,
             pictured at the bottom, reacts to the event with an action included
             in the white block. The white block is subsequently confirmed by
             being buried under $k_2$ blocks. Arrows between blocks of the same
             blockchain indicate authenticated ancestry. The arrow between the
             two blockchains indicates the data transfer needed for the event.}

The operation of event reaction is shown in Figure~\ref{fig.events}. The process
is as follows. First, an event is fired in the source blockchain, shown at the
top. This could be any event that can be emitted using Ethereum's \textsc{emit}
command. This event firing is caused by a certain transaction which is included
at a certain block, indicated in black at the top. This block is then buried
under $k_1$ subsequent blocks within the source blockchain, where the $k_1$
parameter is a security parameter of the scheme depending on the specific
parameters of the source blockchain~\cite{EC:GarKiaLeo15}. As soon as this
confirmation occurs, the target blockchain can react to the event, shown at the
bottom. This reaction occurs in a transaction which is included in a block
within the target blockchain, illustrated in white. As usual, the block needs to
be confirmed by waiting for $k_2$ blocks to be mined on top of it. It is
possible that $k_1 \neq k_2$ because of different guarantees of different
networks such as a difference in block generation time or network synchrony.

Using this basic functionality of event information exchange between
blockchains, we can construct two-way pegged sidechains. In such a construction,
an asset that exists on one blockchain, either as a \emph{native asset}, such as
ether in Ethereum, or as a \emph{token asset}, such as ERC20 tokens in Ethereum,
will gain the ability to be \emph{moved} to a different blockchain, for example
Ethereum Classic. We will use the example of moving ether from the Ethereum
blockchain and into the Ethereum Classic blockchain. Such an action is different
from \emph{exchanging} ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum blockchain,
with ether classic (ETC), the native token of the Ethereum Classic blockchain.
Instead, the asset retains its nature; it maintains its price and its ability to
be used for the same purposes, while being governed by the rules of the new
blockchain, such as improved speed, smaller fees, better features, or different
security guarantees. Furthermore, no counterparty or market is required to
perform the exchange; the transfer is something a party can do on its own.

Our constructions are fully decentralized and not require any sort of
federation.
